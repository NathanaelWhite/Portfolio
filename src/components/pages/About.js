          I graduated from the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp in September of 2021.
          I've coached a multitude of fitness methods since 2014 (gymnastics,
          CrossFit, strength & conditioning). I worked as a therapy practitioner
          with Synergy Release Method from 2016-2021 when I found a passion for
          web development.
